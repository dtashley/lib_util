 *                                    If this pointer is non-nullptr and <i>in_acquire_time</i> is true,
 *                                    the time will be acquired, used for what is output, and assigned to the
 *                                    caller's variable (in this case, this variable is only an output).
 * \param[in]       in_acquire_time   Whether to interact with the operating system to acquire the time.  Described
 *                                    above.
 * \returns                           Nothing.
 * \reentrancyandthreadsafety         This function is re-entrant and thread safe, so long as either the stream
 *                                    isn't accessed by multiple threads, or interleaving of output to the
 *                                    stream is acceptable.
 * \errorsandexceptions               Exceptions are uncaught.  An error writing to the stream will result
 *                                    in an uncaught exception.
